Hello there! Welcome to my fun and quirky personal README file. I promise it won't be boring! ðŸ˜Ž

Who Am I?

My name is Botagoz, but you can call me Bota for short. I'm a DevOps engineer with a passion for problem-solving and creative thinking. I grew up in Kazakhstan and received my bachelor's degree in Prague, Czech Republic. I'm originally from Kazakhstan, but I've lived and worked in different parts of the world, from the US to Europe.

What Do I Value?

I value creativity, collaboration, and humor. I believe that the best ideas come from working together with people from different backgrounds and perspectives.I also think that it's important to have fun and laugh every day, even when things get stressful.
I believe that communication is the foundation of any successful project. As a DevOps engineer, I place a high value on clear communication, both with my colleagues and with clients.

How Do I Work?

When it comes to work, I'm all about finding creative solutions to complex problems. I believe in pushing boundaries and thinking outside the box. I'm not afraid to take risks and try new things. I'm a big believer in the power of teamwork, and I think that everyone has something unique to bring to the table.

Interests

I enjoy cooking and spending time with my family, and I have a great passion for hockey and kickboxing. I was doing the kickboxing for 2 years!
